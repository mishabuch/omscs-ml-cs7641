## Assignment 1 

### Requirements:
- You would require Python > 3.6
- After cloning the project, please install the requirements by running this command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- This would install all the dependencies and you are ready to run the project. 

#### To run the project, you can run the main.py file. 
- Upon running the main.py file, you can choose to run any learner out of the five learners, for either of the two datasets.

##### Learners
1. DecisionTree
2. KNN
3. NeuralNetworks
4. Boosting
5. SVM

##### Datasets

1. Diabetes Retinatherapy
2. Phishing Websites

###### Note: I have tried to use non blocking plot functions through out the code, but there are times when one manually needs to close the plot window in order to continue execution.
